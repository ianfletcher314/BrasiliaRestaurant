            In Brazil, churrasco is the term for a barbecue which originated in
            southern Brazil. It uses a variety of meats, pork, sausage and
            chicken which may be cooked on a purpose-built "churrasqueira", a
            grill with supports for spits or skewers. Come taste the tradition
            friday nights!
