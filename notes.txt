TO DO:
- now I need to make the 769px and lower screen sizes get a central column nav that send you 
    directly to the menu sections or grubhub without the information section.
    -this means making the #churrasco and #drinks divs display:none 
    and hiding the nav section, replacing it with a column nav. this should prevent scrolability
- think about making the font size and size of the container divs % of the screen width?perhaps?
